# Document CRUD RTE Example

This example demonstrates full CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) capabilities for Jive Documents, with a rich text editor interface (using TinyMCE).

## Components

* app.xml - the main gadget xml file
* canvas.html - the view, used for both the home and canvas view
* javascripts/main.js - the logic which sets up the editor, and handles all CRUD operations for documents, via the Jive Core API
* tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/jquery.tinymce.js - the jQuery build of TinyMCE (see http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/tryit/jquery_plugin.php)
