Salesforce Link
===============

This is a Jive app that is used in the content editor to insert link artifacts
that point to Salesforce items. When these links are clicked the app shows a 
quick popup window with the item details directly from Salesforce.

The app requires a Jive Connects service definition for Salesforce and is compatible
with Jive 6 and later.
