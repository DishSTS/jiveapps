# LiveStream Tile
[![JiveDev](dev_logo.png)](https://developer.jiveosftware.com)
This Jive Simple Stream Integration with an embedded App uses the [Jive LiveStreamTile](https://github.com/jivesoftware/jiveapps/tree/master/addons/LiveStreamTile) middleware to generate activities that go live on a user's account to a particular place. The activity's external object contains an embedded App that can display the [LiveStream](https://www.livestream.com) event video. Comments from the external object can be viewed within the Jive LiveStream Tile. See code comments and [blog post](https://community.jivesoftware.com/community/developer/blog/2016/09/27/project-livestream-custom-view-tile-simple-stream-integration-wapp) for more details.
