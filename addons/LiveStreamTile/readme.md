# LiveStream Tile
[![JiveDev](dev_logo.png)](https://developer.jiveosftware.com)
This Jive Custom View Tile integration takes a [LiveStream](https://www.livestream.com) event video and displays the video to be embedded on a relevant page. Can be used along with the LiveStream Simple Stream Integration to generate activities and pull comments from the external object and display the comments in the tile. See code comments and [blog post](https://community.jivesoftware.com/community/developer/blog/2016/09/27/project-livestream-custom-view-tile-simple-stream-integration-wapp) for more details.
