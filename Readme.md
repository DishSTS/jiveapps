Welcome to the Jiveapps Repository 
========
In this repository you'll find two basic things, the applications from Jive and/or our customers & partners that have been contributed to open source, and apps that serve as quick demos or "how to" examples. 

All of the code in here is covered under the Apache 2 license and it's our hope that you'll jump in and not only take these apps and make them your own, but also contribute back your ideas and inspirations.

Please join the conversation in the [Jive Open Innovation Group](https://community.jivesoftware.com/groups/join) in the Jive Community.


Enjoy!
